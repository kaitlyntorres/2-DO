# Objective
Our goal was to create a web application where users can keep track of their upcoming tasks in a todolist format. Users will be able to login and add, view, edit, or delete tasks.
Users can also filter and sort tasks by day and time as well as mark tasks as complete or incomplete

# Usage
Run main.py and click on the localhost

# Guide
Upon launching the app, users will be able to login if they have previosuly created an account or signup if they are a new user. Once the user is auththenticated, they will be able to see all the tasks they
have added, if they added any at all. Below this is a form that users fill out to add a task. The form consist of title, description, date and time, tag, priority, and status. Once added, the task will automatically be placed
with the other tasks to view. Users will have the ability to delete any tasks that no longer need, as well as edit any part of the tasks created. Users can also sort by date and time, so the tasks that need to be completed the soonest will appear on the top.


# Sprints
## Sprint 1 = COMPLETE
Users must be able to add new tasks to todo list = <b>COMPLETE</b> <br />
Users must be able to create an account for the web application = <b>COMPLETE</b><br />
Users must be able to log into the web application before being able to use its functionality = <b>COMPLETE</b> <br />
Users must be able to view all tasks they added = <b>COMPLETE</b> <br />
Usersâ€™ information (task data) must be stored with the corresponding user account = <b>COMPLETE</b>

## Sprint 2 = DONE
Users must be able to delete any tasks on the todo list = <b>COMPLETE</b> <br />
Users must be able to edit any tasks on todo list = <b>COMPLETE</b> <br />
Tasks must be sorted based on day and time = <b>COMPLETE</b> <br />
Users should be able to give each tasks a priority  (high, moderate, low) = <b>COMPLETE</b>

## Sprint 3 = DONE
Users should be able to filter out tasks by date, time, etc <br />
Users should be able to mark tasks as complete or incomplete  = <b>COMPLETE</b> <br />

## Sprint 4 = IN PROGRESS
Users could be able to see a list of tasks that have already passed (task history) <br />
Users could get reminders when their tasks is approaching<br />


## Sprint 5 = PENDING
Users could categorize tasks and sort based on tags <br />
Users could export tasks to CSV<br />
Users could have tasks with a specified date added to a calendar

# Status
This Project is entering Sprint 4 of production
